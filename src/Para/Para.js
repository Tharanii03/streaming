One of the most evocative and beautiful areas of the UK, famous for its pristine lakes, dramatic fells, lush valleys, and rich cultural heritage is nestled in the Northwestern English county of Cumbria. Stretching over 2,362 square kilometers, the Lake District has inspired generations of artists, adventurers and simply those wishing to escape their urban dwellings for a taste of what nature has to offer.
